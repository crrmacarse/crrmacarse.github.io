A bit of a technical knowledgeable guy who gets confused every time if I am\n              really qualified to be part of the Software Development scene or not.

I would just typically go on to research and start with implemenation the\n              moment i would get my momentum going. I am also that office guy you see who&apos;ll\n              put tremendous effort to get things done.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-5\">\n              A *self-acclaimed full stack developer, I worked my way to such structures like CRUD,\n              OOP, MVC, MERN stack, AdonisJS/ Expo/.NET framework, REST Api, and Javascript SPAs.\n              I am not really good at all, but just a purely try hard individual. A team-person who\n              is willing to listen and would love to have discussions about inputs and what to\n              offer to the table.
