              Hi guys! My name is Christian Ryan Refuerzo Macarse. My friends call me either Pablo
              or Wawi. A bit of a technical knowledgeable guy who gets confused every time if I am
              really qualified to be part of the Software Development scene or not. I really don‚Äôt
              know why I am able to make (barely) functional systems and real-world applied software
              <span role="img" aria-label="smile"> ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. </span>
              I&apos;m just really that type of a person who is very eager to learn and a curious
              freak. I would just typically go on to research and start with implemenation the
              moment i would get my momentum going. I am also that office guy you see who&apos;ll
              put tremendous effort to get things done.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              A *self-acclaimed full stack developer, I worked my way to such structures like CRUD,
              OOP, MVC, MERN stack, AdonisJS/ Expo/.NET framework, REST Api, and Javascript SPAs.
              I am not really good at all, but just a purely try hard individual. A team-person who
              is willing to listen and would love to have discussions about inputs and what to
              offer to the table. Now Hire me.
