              Hi guys! My name is Christian Ryan Refuerzo Macarse also known as &quot;Pablo&quot;.
              A technical knowledgeable guy who gets confused every time if I am really qualified
              to be part in the Software Development scene or not. I really donâ€™t know why
              I am able to make (barely) functional systems and real-world applied software.
              I&apos;m just really that type of a person who is very eager to learn and a curious
              freak. Advancing myself everytime through research and implementation, I always
              sharpen my blade in order for me to prepare with the ever fast-paced world
              of IT. I also do like to put tremendous effort to get things done.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-5">
              A *self-acclaimed full stack developer, I worked my way to such structures like CRUD,
              OOP, MVC, MERN stack, AdonisJS/ Expo/.NET framework, REST Api, and Javascript SPAs.
              I am not really good at all, but just a purely try hard individual. A team-person who
              is willing to listen and would love to have discussions about inputs and what to
              offer to the table
