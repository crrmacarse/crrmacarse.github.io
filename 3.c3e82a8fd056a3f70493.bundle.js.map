The default is false.\n * @property {string}     password - For decrypting password-protected PDFs.\n * @property {TypedArray} initialData - A typed array with the first portion or\n *   all of the pdf data. Used by the extension since some data is already\n *   loaded before the switch to range requests.\n * @property {number}     length - The PDF file length.

The default value is `false`.\n * @property {number} maxImageSize - (optional) The maximum allowed image size\n *   in total pixels, i.e. width * height.

The default value is `false`.\n * @property {boolean} disableRange - (optional) Disable range request loading\n *   of PDF files.
