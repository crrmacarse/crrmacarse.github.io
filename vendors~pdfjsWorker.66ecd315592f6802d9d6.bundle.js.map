are encoded following the the CharString Encoding sequence\n * describe in Chapter 6 of the \"Adobe Type1 Font Format\" specification.\n * The value in a byte indicates a command, a number, or subsequent bytes\n * that are to be interpreted in a special way.\n *\n * CharString Number Encoding:\n *  A CharString byte containing the values from 32 through 255 inclusive\n *  indicate an integer. These values are decoded in four ranges.\n *\n * 1. A CharString byte containing a value, v, between 32 and 246 inclusive,\n * indicate the integer v - 139. Thus, the integer values from -107 through\n * 107 inclusive may be encoded in single byte.\n *\n * 2. A CharString byte containing a value, v, between 247 and 250 inclusive,\n * indicates an integer involving the next byte, w, according to the formula:\n * [(v - 247) x 256] + w + 108\n *\n * 3. A CharString byte containing a value, v, between 251 and 254 inclusive,\n * indicates an integer involving the next byte, w, according to the formula:\n * -[(v - 251) * 256] - w - 108\n *\n * 4. A CharString containing the value 255 indicates that the next 4 bytes\n * are a two complement signed integer. The first of these bytes contains the\n * highest order bits, the second byte contains the next higher order bits\n * and the fourth byte contain the lowest order bits.\n *\n *\n * CharString Command Encoding:\n *  CharStrings commands are encoded in 1 or 2 bytes.\n *\n *  Single byte commands are encoded in 1 byte that contains a value between\n *  0 and 31 inclusive.\n *  If a command byte contains the value 12, then the value in the next byte\n *  indicates a command. This \"escape\" mechanism allows many extra commands\n * to be encoded and this encoding technique helps to minimize the length of\n * the charStrings.\n */\nvar Type1CharString = (function
